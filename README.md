# Frogger Clone Arcade Game Project

This is a clone of the classic arcade game 'Frogger' created for Project #3 of my Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. Users will need to safely transport the character across the road to get to the water without hitting a ladybug.

## Getting Started

Open index.html in browser to play game. You can either copy the path into your browser or type 'open index.html' from your terminal after navigating into the correct directory. Use the &#8592;, &#8593;, &#8594;, &#8595; keys on the keyboard to control the character.

## Contributing

The starter code for this repository is from Udacity.
